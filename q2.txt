list of all differences:
1. The rope that is tied to the boat
2. There are 3 lines of tiles on the roof of the well, whereas it's 4 in the original
3. A missing pillar supporting the railing inside the shaded patio (beside the bicycle)
4. The missing nose of the fox
5. The second plowed field is vertical whereas it's horizontal in the original
6. In between the two trees with apples, there is a hay field whereas it's plowed in the original
7. The barrel beside the stove contains white liquid, whereas it's yellow in the original
8. An extra fruit in the second bush, below the carrot field
9. The ear of the 2nd sheep from the right is visible.

It took me ~25 mins to spot these differences.

I seperated both pictures into 5 smaller sections and inspected each section from left to right. Whenever I found a mismatch, I circled the different part and moved on to inspect further. I rechecked 3 times, the first time being a rough guide to find the obvious ones. The second time I concentrated on places in the section where there are alot of elements, and ofcourse started counting things like apples, tiles, boards on fences, pillars etc. That's how I found more mismatches such as the pillar and tiles. In the 3rd check I tried to see if there's anything else left out and tried to match smaller details like shapes of trees, footpath tiles, plough lines. In the 3rd check I found the ear on the sheep.
